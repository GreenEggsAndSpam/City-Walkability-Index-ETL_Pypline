Right now this program just returns the walkability index of many cities in the US. Hopefully in the future I will use this data in tandem
obesity and health data from data.gov to see if there is a correlation of walkability to health in America. 

This is the key for the index  

1– 5.75 Least walkable
5.76 – 10.5 Below average walkable
10.51 – 15.25 Above average walkable
15.26 – 20 Most walkable
